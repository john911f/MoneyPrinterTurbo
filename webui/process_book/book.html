<p class="head">January 1st<br/> <b>CONTROL AND CHOICE</b></p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p class="noindent">“The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I actually control. Where then do I look for good and evil? Not to uncontrollable externals, but within myself to the choices that are my own …”</p>
<p class="right1" id="nt_1">—E<small>PICTETUS</small>, <i>D<small>ISCOURSES</small></i>, 2.5.4–5</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he single most important practice in Stoic philosophy is differentiating between what we can change and what we can’t. What we have influence over and what we do not. A flight is delayed because of weather—no amount of yelling at an airline representative will end a storm. No amount of wishing will make you taller or shorter or born in a different country. No matter how hard you try, you can’t <i>make</i> someone like you. And on top of that, time spent hurling yourself at these immovable objects is time not spent on the things we <i>can</i> change.</p>
<p class="indent">The recovery community practices something called the Serenity Prayer: “God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.” Addicts cannot change the abuse suffered in childhood. They cannot undo the choices they have made or the hurt they have caused. But they <i>can</i> change the future—through the power they have in the present moment. As Epictetus said, they can control the choices they make right now.</p>
<p class="indent">The same is true for us today. If we can focus on making clear what parts of our day are within our control and what parts are not, we will not only be happier, we will have a distinct advantage over other people who fail to realize they are fighting an unwinnable battle.</p>

</div>
<div class="quote">
<p class="noindent">“What is the fruit of these teachings? Only the most beautiful and proper harvest of the truly educated—tranquility, fearlessness, and freedom. We should not trust the masses who say only the free can be educated, but rather the lovers of wisdom who say that only the educated are free.”</p>
<p class="right1" id="nt_2">—E<small>PICTETUS</small>, <i>D<small>ISCOURSES</small></i>, 2.1.21–23a</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hy did you pick up this book? Why pick up any book? Not to seem smarter, not to pass time on the plane, not to hear what you want to hear—there are plenty of easier choices than reading.</p>
<p class="indent">No, you picked up this book because you are learning how to live. Because you want to be freer, fear less, and achieve a state of peace. Education—reading and meditating on the wisdom of great minds—is not to be done for its own sake. It has a purpose.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember that imperative on the days you start to feel distracted, when watching television or having a snack seems like a better use of your time than reading or studying philosophy. Knowledge—self-knowledge in particular—is freedom.</p>

</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">O</span>ne of the hardest things to do in life is to say “No.” To invitations, to requests, to obligations, to the stuff that everyone else is doing. Even harder is saying no to certain time-consuming emotions: anger, excitement, distraction, obsession, lust. None of these impulses feels like a big deal by itself, but run amok, they become a commitment like anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">If you’re not careful, these are precisely the impositions that will overwhelm and consume your life. Do you ever wonder how you can get some of your time back, how you can feel less busy? Start by learning the power of “No!”—as in “No, thank you,” and “No, I’m not going to get caught up in that,” and “No, I just can’t right now.” It may hurt some feelings. It may turn people off. It may take some hard work. But the more you say no to the things that don’t matter, the more you can say yes to the things that do. This will let you live and enjoy your life—the life that <i>you</i> want.</p>

</div>
<div class="quote">
<p class="noindent">“All you need are these: certainty of judgment in the present moment; action for the common good in the present moment; and an attitude of gratitude in the present moment for anything that comes your way.”</p>

</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">P</span>erception, Action, Will. Those are the three overlapping but critical disciplines of Stoicism (as well as the organization of this book and yearlong journey you’ve just begun). There’s more to the philosophy certainly—and we could spend all day talking about the unique beliefs of the various Stoics: “This is what Heraclitus thought …” “Zeno is from Citium, a city in Cyprus, and he believed …” But would such facts really help you day to day? What clarity does trivia provide?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead, the following little reminder sums up the three most essential parts of Stoic philosophy worth carrying with you every day, into every decision:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Control your perceptions.</p>
<p class="indent">Direct your actions properly.</p>
<p class="indent">Willingly accept what’s outside your control.</p>

Robert Greene writes, “By planning to the end you will not be overwhelmed by circumstances and you will know when to stop. Gently guide fortune and help determine the future by thinking far ahead.” The second habit in <i>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i> is: begin with an end in mind.</p>
<p class="indent">Having an end in mind is no guarantee that you’ll reach it—no Stoic would tolerate that assumption—but <i>not</i> having an end in mind is a guarantee you won’t. To the Stoics, <i>oiêsis</i> (false conceptions) are responsible not just for disturbances in the soul but for chaotic and dysfunctional lives and operations. When your efforts are not directed at a cause or a purpose, how will you know what to do day in and day out? How will you know what to say no to and what to say yes to? How will you know when you’ve had enough, when you’ve reached your goal, when you’ve gotten off track, if you’ve never defined what those things are?</p>
<p class="indent">The answer is that you cannot. And so you are driven into failure—or worse, into madness by the oblivion of directionlessness.</p>

A person who doesn’t know any one of these things doesn’t know why they are here. So what to make of people who seek or avoid the praise of those who have no knowledge of where or who they are?”</p>

Sitting down for an on-air interview, a radio DJ asked him, “So, who are you?” In that moment, he had to think, <i>Is this guy really deep or did I drive to the wrong station?</i></p>
<p class="indent">How often are we asked a simple question like “Who are you?” or “What do you do?” or “Where are you from?” Considering it a superficial question—if we even consider it at all—we don’t bother with more than a superficial answer.</p>
<p class="indent">But, gun to their head, most people couldn’t give much in the way of a substantive answer. Could you? Have you taken the time to get clarity about who you are and what you stand for?

<p class="head">January 7th<br/> <b>SEVEN CLEAR FUNCTIONS OF THE MIND</b></p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p class="noindent">“The proper work of the mind is the exercise of choice, refusal, yearning, repulsion, preparation, purpose, and assent. What then can pollute and clog the mind’s proper functioning? Nothing but its own corrupt decisions.”</p>
<p class="right1" id="nt_7">—E<small>PICTETUS</small>, <i>D<small>ISCOURSES</small></i>, 4.11.6–7</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">Let’s break down each one of those tasks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="hang">Choice—to do and think right</p>
<p class="hang">Refusal—of temptation</p>
<p class="hang">Yearning—to be better</p>
<p class="hang">Repulsion—of negativity, of bad influences, of what isn’t true</p>
<p class="hang">Preparation—for what lies ahead or whatever may happen</p>
<p class="hang">Purpose—our guiding principle and highest priority</p>
<p class="hang">Assent—to be free of deception about what’s inside and outside our control (and be ready to accept the latter)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="indent">This is what the mind is here to do. We must make sure that it does—and see everything else as pollution or a corruption.</p>

</div>
<div class="quote">
<p class="noindent">“We must give up many things to which we are addicted, considering them to be good. Otherwise, courage will vanish, which should continually test itself. Greatness of soul will be lost, which can’t stand out unless it disdains as petty what the mob regards as most desirable.</p>

</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hat we consider to be harmless indulgences can easily become full-blown addictions. We start with coffee in the morning, and soon enough we can’t start the day without it. We check our email because it’s part of our job, and soon enough we feel the phantom buzz of the phone in our pocket every few seconds. Soon enough, these harmless habits are running our lives.</p>
<p class="indent">The little compulsions and drives we have not only chip away at our freedom and sovereignty, they cloud our clarity. We think we’re in control—but are we really? As one addict put it, addiction is when we’ve “lost the freedom to abstain.” Let us reclaim that freedom.</p>
<p class="indent">What that addiction is for you can vary: Soda? Drugs? Complaining? Gossip? The Internet? Biting your nails? But you must reclaim the ability to abstain because within it is your clarity and self-control.</p>

</div>
<div class="quote">
<p class="noindent">“Some things are in our control, while others are not. We control our opinion, choice, desire, aversion, and, in a word, everything of our own doing. We don’t control our body, property, reputation, position, and, in a word, everything not of our own doing. Even more, the things in our control are by nature free, unhindered, and unobstructed, while those not in our control are weak, slavish, can be hindered, and are not our own.”</p>

</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>oday, you won’t control the external events that happen. Is that scary? A little, but it’s balanced when we see that we can control our opinion <i>about</i> those events. You decide whether they’re good or bad, whether they’re fair or unfair. You don’t control the situation, but you control what you <i>think</i> about it.</p>
<p class="indent">See how that works? Every single thing that is outside your control—the outside world, other people, luck, karma, whatever—still presents a corresponding area that <i>is</i> in your control. This alone gives us plenty to manage, plenty of power.</p>
<p class="indent">Best of all, an honest understanding of what is within our control provides real clarity about the world: all we have is our own mind. Remember that today when you try to extend your reach outward—that it’s much better and more appropriately directed <i>inward.</i></p>

</div>
<div class="quote">
<p class="noindent">“The essence of good is a certain kind of reasoned choice; just as the essence of evil is another kind. What about externals, then? They are only the raw material for our reasoned choice, which finds its own good or evil in working with them. How will it find the good? Not by marveling at the material! For if judgments about the material are straight that makes our choices good, but if those judgments are twisted, our choices turn bad.”</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Stoics seek steadiness, stability, and tranquility—traits most of us aspire to but seem to experience only fleetingly. How do they accomplish this elusive goal? How does one embody <i>eustatheia</i> (the word Arrian used to describe this teaching of Epictetus)?</p>
<p class="indent">Well, it’s not luck. It’s not by eliminating outside influences or running away to quiet and solitude. Instead, it’s about filtering the outside world through the straightener of our judgment. That’s what our reason can do—it can take the crooked, confusing, and overwhelming nature of external events and make them orderly.</p>
<p class="indent">However, if our judgments are crooked because we don’t use reason, then everything that follows will be crooked, and we will lose our ability to steady ourselves in the chaos and rush of life. If you want to be steady, if you want clarity, proper judgment is the best way.</p>

Still, the Stoic is equally at peace.</p>
<p class="indent">Epictetus is reminding you that serenity and stability are results of your choices and judgment, not your environment. If you seek to avoid all disruptions to tranquility—other people, external events, stress—you will never be successful. Your problems will follow you wherever you run and hide.

<p class="indent">The good news is that it’s pretty easy to remember what is inside our control. According to the Stoics, the circle of control contains just one thing: YOUR MIND. That’s right, even your physical body isn’t completely within the circle. After all, you could be struck with a physical illness or impairment at any moment. You could be traveling in a foreign country and be thrown in jail.</p>
<p class="indent">But this is all good news because it drastically reduces the amount of things that you need to think about. There is clarity in simplicity. While everyone else is running around with a list of responsibilities a mile long—things they’re not actually responsible for—you’ve got just that one-item list.

Every human being is pulled by these internal and external forces that are increasingly more powerful and harder to resist.</p>
<p class="indent">Philosophy is simply asking us to pay careful attention and to strive to be more than a pawn. As Viktor Frankl puts it in <i>The Will to Meaning</i>, “Man is pushed by drives but pulled by values.” These values and inner awareness prevent us from being puppets.

This is true for us as well—we all come to philosophy from different backgrounds, and even within our own lives we experience bouts of good fortune and bad fortune.</p>
<p class="indent">But in all circumstances—adversity or advantage—we really have just one thing we need to do: focus on what is in our control as opposed to what is not. Right now we might be laid low with struggles, whereas just a few years ago we might have lived high on the hog, and in just a few days we might be doing so well that success is actually a burden. One thing will stay constant: our freedom of choice—both in the big picture and small picture.</p>
<p class="indent">Ultimately, this is clarity. Whoever we are, wherever we are—what matters is our choices. What are they? How will we evaluate them? How will we make the most of them? Those are the questions life asks us, regardless of our station. How will you answer?</p>

The idea is to take some time to look inward and examine.</p>
<p class="indent">Taking that time is what Stoics advocated more than almost anything else. We don’t know whether Marcus Aurelius wrote his <i>Meditations</i> in the morning or at night, but we know he carved out moments of quiet alone time—and that he wrote for himself, not for anyone else. If you’re looking for a place to start your own ritual, you could do worse than Marcus’s example and Epictetus’s checklist.</p>

At the end of each day he would ask himself variations of the following questions: <i>What bad habit did I curb today? How am I better? Were my actions just? How can I improve?</i></p>
<p class="indent">At the beginning or end of each day, the Stoic sits down with his journal and reviews: what he did, what he thought, what could be improved. It’s for this reason that Marcus Aurelius’s <i>Meditations</i> is a somewhat inscrutable book—it was for personal clarity and not public benefit. Writing down Stoic exercises was and is also a form of practicing them, just as repeating a prayer or hymn might be.</p>
<p class="indent">Keep your own journal, whether it’s saved on a computer or in a little notebook. Take time to consciously recall the events of the previous day. Be unflinching in your assessments. Notice what contributed to your happiness and what detracted from it. Write down what you’d like to work on or quotes that you like. By making the effort to record such thoughts, you’re less likely to forget them. An added bonus: you’ll have a running tally to track your progress too.</p>

Scott Fitzgerald, who often glamorized the lifestyles of the rich and famous in books like <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, opens one of his short stories with the now classic lines: “Let me tell you about the very rich. They are different from you and me.” A few years after this story was published, his friend Ernest Hemingway teased Fitzgerald by writing, “Yes, they have more money.”</p>
<p class="indent">That’s what Seneca is reminding us. As someone who was one of the richest men in Rome, he knew firsthand that money only marginally changes life. It doesn’t solve the problems that people without it seem to think it will. In fact, no material possession will. External things can’t fix internal issues.</p>
<p class="indent">We constantly forget this—and it causes us so much confusion and pain. As Hemingway would later write of Fitzgerald, “He thought [the rich] were a special glamorous race and when he found they weren’t it wrecked him as much as any other thing that wrecked him.” Without a change the same will be true for us.</p>

<p class="indent">It was also from Rusticus that Marcus was introduced to Epictetus. In fact, Rusticus loaned Marcus his personal copy of Epictetus’s lectures. Marcus clearly wasn’t satisfied with just getting the gist of these lectures and didn’t simply accept them on his teacher’s recommendation. Paul Johnson once joked that Edmund Wilson read books “as though the author was on trial for his life.” That’s how Marcus read Epictetus—and when the lessons passed muster, he <i>absorbed</i> them. They became part of his DNA as a human being. He quoted them at length over the course of his life, finding real clarity and strength in words, even amid the immense luxury and power he would come to possess.</p>

The first has to do with desires and aversions—that a person may never miss the mark in desires nor fall into what repels them. The second has to do with impulses to act and not to act—and more broadly, with duty—that a person may act deliberately for good reasons and not carelessly. The third has to do with freedom from deception and composure and the whole area of judgment, the assent our mind gives to its perceptions. Of these areas, the chief and most urgent is the first which has to do with the passions, for strong emotions arise only when we fail in our desires and aversions.”</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>oday, let’s focus on the three areas of training that Epictetus laid out for us.</p>
<p class="indent">First, we must consider what we should desire and what we should be averse to. Why? So that we want what is good and avoid what is bad. It’s not enough to just listen to your body—because our attractions often lead us astray.</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we must examine our impulses to act—that is, our <i>motivations.</i> Are we doing things for the right reasons? Or do we act because we haven’t stopped to think? Or do we believe that we <i>have</i> to do something?</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, there is our judgment. Our ability to see things clearly and properly comes when we use our great gift from nature: <i>reason.</i></p>
<p class="indent">These are three distinct areas of training, but in practice they are inextricably intertwined. Our judgment affects what we desire, our desires affect how we act, just as our judgment determines how we act. But we can’t just expect this to happen. We must put real thought and energy into each area of our lives. If we do, we’ll find real clarity and success.</p>
