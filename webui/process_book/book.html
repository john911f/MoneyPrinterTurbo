</div>
<div class="quote">
<p class="noindent">“Cato practiced the kind of public speech capable of moving the masses, believing proper political philosophy takes care like any great city to maintain the warlike element. But he was never seen practicing in front of others, and no one ever heard him rehearse a speech. When he was told that people blamed him for his silence, he replied, ‘Better they not blame my life. I begin to speak only when I’m certain what I’ll say isn’t better left unsaid.’ ”</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t’s easy to act—to just dive in. It’s harder to stop, to pause, to think: <i>No, I’m not sure I need to do that yet. I’m not sure I am ready.</i> As Cato entered politics, many expected swift and great things from him—stirring speeches, roaring condemnations, wise analyses. He was aware of this pressure—a pressure that exists on all of us at all times—and resisted. It’s easy to pander to the mob (and to our ego).</p>
<p class="indent">Instead, he waited and <i>prepared.</i> He parsed his own thoughts, made sure he was not reacting emotionally, selfishly, ignorantly, or prematurely. Only then would he speak—when he was confident that his words were worthy of being heard.</p>
<p class="indent">To do this requires awareness. It requires us to stop and evaluate ourselves honestly. Can you do that?</p>

<p class="head">February 23rd<br/> <b>CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE NO CARE FOR OUR FEELINGS</b></p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p class="noindent">“You shouldn’t give circumstances the power to rouse anger, for they don’t care at all.”</p>
<p class="right1" id="nt_54">—M<small>ARCUS</small> A<small>URELIUS</small>, <i>M<small>EDITATIONS</small></i>, 7.38</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">A</span> significant chunk of Marcus Aurelius’s <i>Meditations</i> is made up of short quotes and passages from other writers. This is because Marcus wasn’t necessarily trying to produce an original work—instead he was <i>practicing</i>, reminding himself here and there of important lessons, and sometimes these lessons were things he had read.</p>
<p class="indent">This particular quote is special because it comes from a play by Euripides, which, except for a handful of quoted fragments like this, is lost to us. From what we can gather about the play, Bellerophon, the hero, comes to doubt the existence of the gods. But in this line, he is saying: Why bother getting mad at causes and forces far bigger than us? Why do we take these things personally? After all, external events are not sentient beings—they cannot respond to our shouts and cries—and neither can the mostly indifferent gods.</p>
<p class="indent">That’s what Marcus was reminding himself of here: circumstances are incapable of considering or caring for your feelings, your anxiety, or your excitement. They don’t care about your reaction. They are not people. So stop acting like getting worked up is having an impact on a given situation. Situations don’t care at all.</p>

<p class="head">February 24th<br/> <b>THE REAL SOURCE OF HARM</b></p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p class="noindent">“Keep in mind that it isn’t the one who has it in for you and takes a swipe that harms you, but rather the harm comes from your own belief about the abuse. So when someone arouses your anger, know that it’s really your own opinion fueling it. Instead, make it your first response not to be carried away by such impressions, for with time and distance self-mastery is more easily achieved.”</p>
<p class="right1" id="nt_55">—E<small>PICTETUS</small>, <i>E<small>NCHIRIDION</small></i>, 20</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Stoics remind us that there really is no such thing as an objectively good or bad occurrence. When a billionaire loses $1 million in market fluctuation, it’s not the same as when you or I lose a million dollars. Criticism from your worst enemy is received differently than negative words from a spouse. If someone sends you an angry email but you never see it, did it actually happen? In other words, these situations require our participation, context, and categorization in order to be “bad.”</p>
<p class="indent">Our reaction is what actually decides whether harm has occurred. If we feel that we’ve been wronged and get angry, of course that’s how it will seem. If we raise our voice because we feel we’re being confronted, naturally a confrontation will ensue.</p>
<p class="indent">But if we retain control of ourselves, we decide whether to label something good or bad. In fact, if that same event happened to us at different points in our lifetime, we might have very different reactions. So why not choose now to <i>not</i> apply these labels? Why not choose <i>not</i> to react?</p>

<p class="head">February 25th<br/> <b>THE SMOKE AND DUST OF MYTH</b></p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p class="noindent">“Keep a list before your mind of those who burned with anger and resentment about something, of even the most renowned for success, misfortune, evil deeds, or any special distinction. Then ask yourself, how did that work out? Smoke and dust, the stuff of simple myth trying to be legend …”</p>

</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n Marcus Aurelius’s writings, he constantly points out how the emperors who came before him were barely remembered just a few years later. To him, this was a reminder that no matter how much he conquered, no matter how much he inflicted his will on the world, it would be like building a castle in the sand—soon to be erased by the winds of time.</p>
<p class="indent">The same goes for those driven to the heights of hate or anger or obsession or perfectionism. Marcus liked to point out that Alexander the Great—one of the most passionate and ambitious men who ever lived—was buried in the same ground as his mule driver. Eventually, all of us will pass away and slowly be forgotten. We should enjoy this brief time we have on earth—not be enslaved to emotions that make us miserable and dissatisfied.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>braham Lincoln occasionally got fuming mad with a subordinate, one of his generals, even a friend. Rather than taking it out on that person directly, he’d write a long letter, outlining his case why they were wrong and what he wanted them to know. Then Lincoln would fold it up, put the letter in the desk drawer, and never send it. Many of these letters survive only by chance.</p>
<p class="indent">He knew, as the former emperor of Rome knew, that it’s easy to fight back. It’s tempting to give them a piece of your mind. But you almost always end up with regret. You almost always wish you <i>hadn’t</i> sent the letter. Think of the last time you flew off the handle. What was the outcome? Was there any benefit?</p>

<p class="head">February 27th<br/> <b>CULTIVATING INDIFFERENCE WHERE OTHERS GROW PASSION</b></p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p class="noindent">“Of all the things that are, some are good, others bad, and yet others indifferent. The good are virtues and all that share in them; the bad are the vices and all that indulge them; the indifferent lie in between virtue and vice and include wealth, health, life, death, pleasure, and pain.”</p>
<p class="right1" id="nt_58">—E<small>PICTETUS</small>, <i>D<small>ISCOURSES</small></i>, 2.19.12b–13</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>magine the power you’d have in your life and relationships if all the things that trouble everyone else—how thin they are, how much money they have, how long they have left to live, how they will die—didn’t matter so much. What if, where others were upset, envious, excited, possessive, or greedy, you were objective, calm, and clearheaded? Can you envision that? Imagine what it would do for your relationships at work, or for your love life, or your friendships.</p>
<p class="indent">Seneca was an incredibly wealthy, even famous, man—yet he was a Stoic. He had many material things, yet, as the Stoics say, he was also indifferent to them. He enjoyed them while they were there, but he accepted that they might someday disappear. What a better attitude than desperately craving <i>more</i> or fearfully dreading losing even one penny. Indifference is solid middle ground.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s not about avoidance or shunning, but rather not giving any possible outcome more power or preference than is appropriate. This not easy to do, certainly, but if you could manage, how much more relaxed would you be?</p>

</div>
<div class="quote">
<p class="noindent">“The soul is like a bowl of water, and our impressions are like the ray of light falling upon the water. When the water is troubled, it appears that the light itself is moved too, but it isn’t. So, when a person loses their composure it isn’t their skills and virtues that are troubled, but the spirit in which they exist, and when that spirit calms down so do those things.”</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">Y</span>ou messed up a little. Or maybe you messed up <i>a lot.</i></p>
<p class="indent">So? That doesn’t change the philosophy that you know. It’s not as if your reasoned choice has permanently abandoned you. Rather, it was you who temporarily abandoned it.</p>

<div class="quote">
<p class="noindent">“When children stick their hand down a narrow goody jar they can’t get their full fist out and start crying. Drop a few treats and you will get it out! Curb your desire—don’t set your heart on so many things and you will get what you need.”</p>
<p class="right1" id="nt_60">—E<small>PICTETUS</small>, <i>D<small>ISCOURSES</small></i>, 3.9.22</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">“W</span>e can have it all” is the mantra of our modern lives. Work, family, purpose, success, leisure time—we want all of this, at the same time (right now, to boot).</p>
<p class="indent">In Greece, the lecture hall (<i>scholeion</i>) was a leisure center where students contemplated the higher things (the good, true, and beautiful) for the purpose of living a better life. It was about prioritization, about questioning the priorities of the outside world. Today, we’re too busy getting things, just like kids jamming their hand down a jar of goodies, to do much of this questioning.</p>
<p class="indent">“Don’t set your heart on so many things,” says Epictetus. Focus. Prioritize. Train your mind to ask: <i>Do I need this thing? What will happen if I do not get it? Can I make do without it?</i></p>
<p class="indent">The answers to these questions will help you relax, help you cut out all the needless things that make you busy—too busy to be balanced or happy.</p>
